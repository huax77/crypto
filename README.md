#  Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting and Strategy Backtesting
## Forecasting Price Movements with Predictive Modeling

This project investigates the feasibility of forecasting near-term cryptocurrency price movements using machine learning models trained on historical OHLCV data. The goal is to transform these forecasts into actionable trading strategies that outperform standard market baselines.

## 📋 Project Overview

The core research question is whether we can build ML models that provide a statistical edge in predicting short-term price direction (up or down). The project follows these key steps:
1.  **Problem Framing**: The task is treated as a binary classification problem.
2.  **Model Exploration**: A range of models are tested, from simple linear regressions to complex non-linear ensembles and neural networks.
3.  **Strategy Evaluation**: Model performance is measured by backtesting trading strategies (e.g., Long-Short) and evaluating their cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios against baselines like Buy-and-Hold.

## 📊 Data & Features

### Data Source
* **Assets**: BTC, BNB, ETH, SOL, XRP
* **Time Range**: January 1, 2021 – April 29, 2025
* **Source**: Yahoo Finance, Kaggle
* **Download**: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ADpUoKo2IAiTaNEEpOH0nthxmhFyCiw6/view?usp=sharing).
* **Time Intervals**: Data was resampled and evaluated at 1-minute, 10-minute, 4-hour, and 1-day frequencies. The 10-minute interval provided the most robust results.
* **Data Split**:
    * **Training Set**: All data before January 1, 2025.
    * **Test Set**: All data from January 1, 2025, to April 29, 2025.

### Feature Engineering
A rich feature set was engineered to capture different aspects of market dynamics:
* **Price & Return Features**: Relative changes between OHLC values.
* **Momentum & Volatility Features**: Rolling standard deviations, moving averages, and momentum indicators.
* **Trend Features**: Signals based on the convergence/divergence of short-term and long-term moving averages (SMA, EMA).
* **Volume Features**: Metrics to gauge buying and selling pressure.
* **Time/Seasonality Features**: Sinusoidal encoding of the time of day and day of week to model periodic patterns.

## 🤖 Models & Validation

### Models Tested
* ARIMA
* Logistic Regression
* LightGBM
* XGBoost
* LSTM

### Validation
A rigorous, temporally-aware validation process was used to prevent data leakage:
* An **expanding-window cross-validation** was applied to the training set.
* The final models were evaluated on a completely **out-of-sample test set** (all data after Jan 1, 2025).

## 📈 Key Results (10-Minute Interval)
![model_performance_comparison_enhanced](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f296b10a-6252-4356-b0bb-31da57da8252)

All machine learning models demonstrated a significant performance uplift over the ARIMA and Buy-and-Hold baselines on the 10-minute interval test set.

| Model                 | Annualized Return | Sharpe Ratio |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Logistic Regression** | **16.91%** | **0.68** |
| XGBoost               | 15.40%            | 0.64         |
| LSTM               | 15.33%             | 0.63         |
| LightGBM              | 12.80%            | 0.41         |
| ARIMA (Baseline)      | -3.81%            | -0.23        |
| Buy & Hold (Baseline) | -8.11%            | -0.27        |

## Conclusion & Next Steps

### Conclusion
1.  **Effective Strategies**: The results confirm that ML models can generate strategies with strong, positive risk-adjusted returns in volatile crypto markets.
2.  **Market Dependence**: Model performance is highest during clear trending phases and tends to degrade in sideways or range-bound markets.

### Future Work
* **Regime-Specific Models**: Retrain and test models specifically for different market regimes (e.g., bull, bear, flat).
* **Alternative Data**: Integrate new data sources, such as on-chain metrics and order book data.
* **Live Deployment**: Explore pathways for real-time model deployment and automated portfolio rebalancing.
